# Project Context: Local NotebookLM Clone

## Overview
This is a local-first, Gemini-powered multimodal knowledge workspace (NotebookLM style). It enables users to query, analyze, and synthesize insights from heterogeneous data sources (Text, SQL, Images, Video) using an agentic loop.

## Core Philosophy
- **Agile WBS**: Work is broken down into Epics (Phases), Features, and Tickets.
- **Test-Driven**: Every epic has strict exit criteria including automated tests. Scaffolding includes a test harness from Day 1.
- **Incremental**: "Walking Skeleton" first (End-to-End data flow), then flesh out features.
- **Quality**: No "building castles in the air". Working, testable software at every step.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, DuckDB, Chroma/FAISS, Pydantic.
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite.
- **AI**: Gemini Pro/Flash, Gemini Embeddings, Gemini Vision.

## Current State
- **Phase**: Epic 0 (Initialization & Scaffolding)
- **Status**: Planning complete. Ready to start implementation.
